# *tng* source files

- `tng.md` the main source file
- `makefile.md` the makefile for the project
- `boot.sh` use this script to create the `tng` program for the first time.
- `boot.bat` use this script on Windows to create the `tng.exe` program using MSVC (`cl`)
- `tng2htm.md` the source for the advanced formatter/beautifier (TODO)
- `tng2md.md` the source for the MarkDown *augmenter* which add more information to an existing `tng` source.

The directory `boot` contains the source needed to bootstrap `tng`.
